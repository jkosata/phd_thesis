 \chapter{Nonlinear dynamical systems} \label{ch:nonlin_intro}
 
 \begin{chapterabstract}
 	
 	Having found in Part~\ref{part:spatial} of this thesis , we now turn to investigate the time evolution of these modes. 
 	
 	The temporal behaviour of the modes is governed by nonlinear ordinary differential equations. 
 	
 	We then introduce the method of harmonic balance, which is the primary tool to treat nonlinear systems in this and the following chapters.

 	The material presented in this chapter is largely taken from \cite{Kosata_2022a},  dedicated to the software package HarmonicBalance.jl, which is the main subject of Appendix~\ref{app:hb}.
